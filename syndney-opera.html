                Mention "Sydney, Australia" and most people think of the Opera House. Shaped like huge shells or
                billowing sails, this
                famous building on Sydney's Bennelong Point graces the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is one of
                the world's
                great architectural icons. The location is stunning. Water surrounds the structure on three sides, and
                the Royal Botanic
                Gardens border it to the south.</p>

                Danish architect, JÃ¸rn Utzon won an international competition for its design but withdrew from the
                project after
                technical and financing problems. Construction was finally completed in 1973 at a cost ten times the
                original budget. By
                this time, Utzon had left the country never returning to see his magnificent creation.

                Today, you can enjoy a performance here; dine at one of the restaurants; or take a tour of the building,
                which
                encompasses theaters, studios, a concert hall, exhibition rooms, and a cinema
