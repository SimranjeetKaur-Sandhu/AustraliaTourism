                Melbourne, Australia's second largest city, is a popular stop on many Australian itineraries -
                especially for culture
                vultures. Galleries, theaters, restaurants, shops, and its distinctly European feel are the main draws
                of this
                sophisticated city on the Yarra River. It's also a green city, with parks, gardens, and open spaces
                occupying almost a
                third of its total area. Highlights of the city include the Royal Botanic Gardens; Federation Square;
                the National
                Gallery of Victoria; and the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where sports fans can watch cricket in the summer
                and Australian
                Rules football in the winter. Shoppers flock to the elegant Royal Arcade on Bourke Street, as well as
                Chapel Street; the
                Melbourne Central Shopping Center; and the Queen Victoria Market, which has been selling fruits,
                vegetables, clothes,
                and crafts for more than a century.
