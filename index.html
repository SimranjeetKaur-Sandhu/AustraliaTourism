                <h2>Reasons why you need to vist australia at least once in your life:</h2>
                <p>With so many good reasons to visit Australia, like its diverse landscapes, friendly locals and a long
                    list of amazing
                    ‘bucket list’ experiences, it’s clear why so many backpackers head here first. It’s unbelievable
                    size and vastness means
                    that there is a little something for every kind of traveller, whether you are looking for an island
                    getaway, a unique
                    cultural experience, an adrenaline fix, to get in touch with nature or an all-round party!

                    The East Coast alone stretches a gigantic 4000 km from Melbourne to Cairns and would take you around
                    50 hours of nonstop
                    driving to cover the entire coastline. Australia is home to over 10,685 beaches, over 500 national
                    parks and, drum-roll…
                    8,222 islands.</p>
