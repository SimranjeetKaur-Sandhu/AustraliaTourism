                Visible from outer space, the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef is one of the largest living
                structures on the
                planet. In 1975, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park was established to protect its fragile ecosystems,
                which include
                more than 3,000 coral reefs; 600 continental islands, including the beautiful Whitsunday group; 300
                coral cays; and
                inshore mangrove islands. One of the seven wonders of the natural world, the park stretches for 2,300
                kilometers along
                the state of Queensland, on Australia's east coast (that's about the distance between Mexico and
                Vancouver). Diving and
                snorkeling are spectacular. The astounding array of marine life includes soft and hard corals, more than
                1,600 species
                of tropical fish, sharks, dugongs, dolphins, turtles, rays, and giant clams. If you prefer to stay dry,
                you can see the
                reef from underwater viewing stations and glass bottom boats. On the mainland, Cairns, Port Douglas, and
                Airlie Beach
                are the main launching points for tours.
