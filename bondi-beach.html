                Bronzed bodies, blond sand, backpackers, and surf - throw it all together and you get one of the world's
                most famous
                beaches. Only 15 minutes by car from the city center, Bondi Beach is home to one of the oldest surf life
                saving clubs in
                the world. It's also a great spot for a seaside stroll or picnic, and crowds of tourists and locals
                gather here to
                celebrate Christmas and ring in the New Year. A great way to soak up the sea views is to stroll along
                the scenic Bondi
                to Bronte coastal walk, which begins at the southern end of the beach and follows the coastline for six
                kilometers along
                sandstone cliffs. Shops, cafes, and restaurants lie across the street from this famous coastal strip.
                Other attractions
                around the beach include the Sunday markets, ocean pool, and skate park. Take care when swimming at
                Bondi. Strong rip
                tides often sweep unsuspecting swimmers out to sea, especially at the southern end of this
                kilometer-long strand, so
                swimmers should stay between the flags. There's a reason the Aussies made a reality TV show called Bondi
                Rescue.
